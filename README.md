# Experiments with word embeddings and language models

This repo contains experiments with SpaCy for sentence similarity, also trying ELMo and similar models.

Run the spacy similarity:

```bash
streamlit run main_spacy.py
```

Run the infersent similarity:

```bash
streamlit run main_infersent.py
```

Run the Universal sentence encoder similarity:

```bash
streamlit run main_universalsentenceencoder.py
```
